# 📈 Customer Engagement Predictor

This project is an interactive machine learning dashboard that predicts whether a customer is likely to engage with a new financial product. Built with **Streamlit**, the app supports multiple models including **Random Forest**, **Logistic Regression**, and **XGBoost**, all wrapped in **Scikit-learn Pipelines** for clean preprocessing and deployment.

## 🔍 Features

- Real-time prediction of customer engagement
- Dynamic model switching (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost)
- Clean and intuitive UI built with Streamlit
- Pie chart visualization of prediction probability
- Fully reproducible with synthetic data

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Streamlit for UI
- Matplotlib for pie chart visualization
- Joblib for model persistence
- Git for version control
